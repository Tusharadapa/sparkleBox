          Getting your kid ready for Kindergarten 2 (KG-2) Syllabus with us!

        <p>
          Parents, it's time to get excited. Your child has just entered the
          last stage of pre-primary education, and you're so looking forward to
          seeing their progress from learning their first words to turning into
          an excellent student! The fact that they are getting promoted to
          Kindergarten-2 is beyond thrilling. These toddlers will soon turn into
          little brainiacs with all sorts of new skills! Your days to hover
          around their heads to ensure continuous learning are almost over! As a
          parent, it can be hard to accept that your child is growing up way too
          fast and doesn't need you around much anymore. But the truth of the
          matter will surprise you: they like having mom and dad in their lives!
          Spending time with kids is the most important thing a parent can do to
          help them grow into happy and successful adults. A recent study found
          that taking just one hour out of each day while helping kids with
          their Kindergarten-2 syllabus has helped parents build close
          relationships with their kids! This time with your nippers will have
          lasting effects on how well-connected your child feels to you in
          general, along with decreased rates of depression or anxiety among
          children around five years old! When we are connected emotionally,
          there's less room left open for stressors.
